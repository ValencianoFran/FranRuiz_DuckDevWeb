Hi! my name is Fran Ruiz Gimenez and I am the game designer of DuckDev on our project [A Link between ages](https://github.com/carcasanchez/ALinkBetweenAges/wiki).
I have worked as a multidisciplinar member making the entire game design, programming and helping the team with the art and his integration on the game.

# **Game Design**


# Gameplay  

Taking hack and slash and adventure's games as a reference, We've decided to make a frenetic combat gameplay with exploration elements like items and new abilities. [Items details](https://github.com/carcasanchez/ALinkBetweenAges/wiki/Items).

# Enemies 

There are six types of enemies units. Each one with different characteristics. [More details](https://github.com/carcasanchez/ALinkBetweenAges/wiki/Enemies).

# Final Boss  

To make an ending with a twist, we decided thah Zelda would be the boss.
She have three phases with different attacks on each one. [More details](https://github.com/carcasanchez/ALinkBetweenAges/wiki/Final-Boss).

# Level design 

I have made and documented a new level design for the game, adapting it correctly to the gameplay to control the game flow.

# Narrative  

The core of this game is the gameplay, but there is a story behind to produce the correct cohesion, making the game more solid and set new goals to the player.

# **Programming**


# Dialogue manager  

IÂ´ve made a non-branching dialogue system to create dialogues on the game. There is no interaction with the NPC but if you talk with him twice will change his dialogue.

Also I made a research about dialogues on videogames and how to program it, you can check it [here](https://botttos.github.io/DialogueManagerForVideoGames/).

# Shop system  

I've integrated a simple shop system where player can buy objects interacting with it.
