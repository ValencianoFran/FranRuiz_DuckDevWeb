Hi! my name is Fran Ruiz Gimenez and I am the game designer of DuckDev on our project [A Link between ages](https://github.com/carcasanchez/ALinkBetweenAges/wiki).
I have worked as a multidisciplinar member making the game design, programming and helping the team with the art and his integration on the game.

# Game Design
 **Gameplay**  

Taking hack and slash and adventure's games as a reference, We've decided to make a frenetic combat gameplay with exploration elements like items and new abilities.

 **Enemies**  

There are five types of enemies units. Each one with different characteristics.

 **Final Boss**  

To make an ending with a twist, we decided thah Zelda would be the boss.
She have three phases with different attacks on each one.

 **Level design**  

I have made a complete new level design, adapting it correctly to the gameplay to control the game flow.

 **Narrative**  

The most important part of the game is the gameplay, but there is a story behind to produce the correct cohesion, making the game more solid and set new goals to the player.

# Programming
 **Dialogue manager**  

IÂ´ve made a non-branching dialogue system to create dialogues on the game. There is no interaction with the NPC but if you talk with him twice will change his dialogue.

Also I made a research about dialogues on videogames and how to program it, you can check it [here](https://botttos.github.io/DialogueManagerForVideoGames/).

 **Shop system**  

I've integrated a simple shop system where player can buy objects interacting with it.

 **Implement items**  

Life potions, stamina potions, bow and arrow item drops also been my task.

Bombs item integration too, including his functionality.

# Others
 **Sprites** 

I have performed the NPCs sprites, bomb and explosion sprites and the enemies dead sprites.

 **Boss room**  

Where first phase takes place.


 **Art polish**  

 Adding shadows to sprites used on Kakariko village, forest and improving map decoration and gameflow with Tiled.
